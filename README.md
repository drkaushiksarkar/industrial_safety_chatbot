# industrial_safety_chatbot Design
## Project Overview:

**Capstone project:**
This is a capstone project to design a machine learning/ deep learning based chatbot utility which can help the professional to highlight the safety risk as per the industry description.


**Database:** The database comes from one of the biggest industry in Brazil and in the world. It is an urgent need for industries/companies around the
globe to understand why employees still suffer some injuries/accidents in plants. Sometimes they also die in such environment. The database includes records of accidents from 12 different plants in 03 different countries which every line in the data is an
occurrence of an accident.


**Description of Data:** The dataset contains 10 columns that details  timestamp or time/date information, which country the accident occurred, the city where the manufacturing plant is located, which sector the plant belongs to, from I to VI, it registers how severe was the accident,  Depending on the Accident Level, the database also registers how severe the accident could have been (due to other factors involved in the accident), gender of the person, if the injured person is an employee or a third party, some description of the risk involved in the accident.

## Project Milestones:


**Milestone 1:**


Input: Interim report


Process:


‣ Step 1: Import the data


‣ Step 2: Data cleansing


‣ Step 3: Data preprocessing


‣ Step 4: Data preparation to be used for AIML model learning


Output: Clean data as .xlsx or .csv file to be used for AIML model learning


**Milestone 2:**


Input: Output of milestone 1


‣ Process:


‣ Step 1: NLP pre processing


‣ Step 2: Design, train and test machine learning classifiers


‣ Step 3: Design, train and test Neural networks classifiers


‣ Step 4: Design, train and test RNN or LSTM classifiers


‣ Step 5: Choose the best performing model classifier and pickle it.


Output: Pickled model to be used for future prediction


**Milestone 3:**


Input: Pickled model from milestone 2


‣ Process:


‣ Step 1: Design a clickable UI which can automate tasks performed under milestone 1


‣ Step 2: Design a clickable UI which can automate tasks performed under milestone 2


‣ Step 3: Design a clickable UI based chatbot interface


‣ Output: Clickable UI based chatbot interface which accepts text as input and replies back with relevant answers.
